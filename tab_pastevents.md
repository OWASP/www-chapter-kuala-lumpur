**Topic: Security Championing**
Abstract:<br>
Resource, visibility and advocacy are always the main problems for the
information security team in any company. Time and head count will
always be scarce for the mandated scope of work. For a security bug, we
might have to check all corners, rather than someone telling it to us.
And no one actually thinks that infosec guys are the hero, right?
Security championing model tries to be the silver bullet for all those,
especially in companies who want to incorporate DevSecOps. Yet, the
implementation is not without obstacle. It may even introduce new
problems along the way.
End of the talk one would be able to understand<br>
1\. What is security championing?<br>
2\. Who should implement security champion model and when is the best
time?<br>
3\. Where we can find and evangelize these security champions?

**Vandy Putrandika**<br>
Vandy is a security, governance and project management generalist who is
passionate about digital strategy and transformation. Currently he works
at Bukalapak as the Head of Information Security and managing the
super-awesome security team inside while juggling with several security
programs.<br>
Topic :<br>
**An architectural approach for decentralized applications**
<br>
1\. Understanding web 2.0 and web 3.0<br>
2\. The pros and cons of web 3.0<br>
3\. What are decentralized applications?<br>
4\. What are the benefits of decentralized application?<br>
5\. How to build a decentralized application?<br>
6\. How to secure decentralized application?<br>

2\. Building a tailored AppSec Program using OpenSAMM by Suman Sourav &
Tuyen Do
**Abstract: Building a tailored AppSec Program using OpenSAMM**

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to
help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software
security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization.
The resources provided by SAMM will aid in:

â€¢ Evaluating an organizationâ€™s existing software security practices
â€¢ Building a balanced software security program in well-defined
iterations
â€¢ Demonstrating concrete improvements to a security assurance program
â€¢ Defining and measuring security-related activities within an
organization

This session is focused on the practical implementation of an AppSec
Program based on your organization needs and business risk appetite.
Most of the AppSec program fails because of lack of programmatic
approach and strategic rollout. Participants will learn about an
importance of a Security Program Management, how it solves people,
process and technologies challenges in implementing an AppSec program,
driving results and metrics relevant to the different stakeholders.

'''
Topic Extract :
Find security issues on development stage using open source static
analysis security testing (SAST), so that developer will be able to
identify security issues on earlier stage of software development life
cycle, rather than waiting for penetration testing stage.
SAST demo will be conducted with command line interface usage, IDE
integration, & Jenkins integration. The demo will scan and found
security issues on several programming language such as Java, python, &
ruby
