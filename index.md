 <br>
The important values that are crucial in building a Cyber Security Community are:<br><br>
1.	<b>Collaboration:</b> Cyber security threats are complex and constantly evolving. Therefore, a collaborative approach is crucial in addressing them. Individuals and organizations within the community must work together, share information, and collaborate on solutions to tackle cyber threats.<br>
2.	<b>Trust:</b> Trust is a fundamental element of any community, including the cyber security community. Members of the community must trust one another to share information and work together to achieve common goals. Trust can be built through transparency, honesty, and accountability.<br>
3.	<b>Education:</b> Cyber security threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread. It is essential that the community is educated on the latest threats and security measures to defend against them. Education can take many forms, including training programs, workshops, and sharing of best practices.<br>
 4.	<b>Inclusivity:</b> A strong cyber security community must be inclusive and welcoming to people of all backgrounds, including race, gender, and ethnicity. A diverse community can bring different perspectives and approaches to addressing cyber security challenges.<br>
 5.	<b>Responsiveness:</b> Cyber security threats can emerge at any time, and the community must be able to respond quickly and effectively. This requires a culture of responsiveness, where members are prepared to act swiftly to mitigate threats and prevent further damage.<br>
 6.	<b>Innovation:</b> The cyber security landscape is constantly changing, and the community must be innovative in its approach to tackling new threats. This means embracing new technologies, tools, and strategies to stay ahead of the curve.<br>
By embracing these values, OUR community can work together to build a Safer and Robust online world for all.
